Documentation of understudied and endangered languages is important for the preservation of cultural knowledge and for the advancement of scientific theories about human language. Endangered languages need to be studied in their broader ecological context in order to better understand the processes of language contact, maintenance, and shift: this includes the psychological context (the interaction of different varieties in the minds of bi- or multilingual speakers) and the sociological context (the specific relations among minoritized varieties and their interactions with standard languages, and how these different varieties function within society as mediums of communication). This project will document and analyze a group of endangered language varieties spoken in a linguistically diverse border region, which have developed in contact with one another for hundreds of years. It also examines the specific situation of endangered dialects in contact with closely related varieties, which have been unduly ignored in research on language endangerment. This project will therefore provide us with important information that can help us understand fundamental issues of language variation and change, and will make theoretical contributions that are generalizable to other language-contact situations. This project will create an online searchable spoken corpus that will allow for the quantitative analysis of language variation and code-switching practices by multilingual speakers. It will leverage existing resources to develop an open-source pipeline for processing and annotating multilingual data from under-resourced varieties, which is a cutting-edge area of research in NLP. The corpus interface will be built as a Shiny application, which can be adapted for use with other corpora and which allows many other possibilities for data visualization and statistical analysis, since it uses the popular R software environment. The web interface will also be designed to facilitate use by non-specialists, in order to make these data accessible to members of the local communities who are interested in the linguistic and cultural heritage of the region or in language maintenance and revitalization.

Start recording. Read the oral consent script and obtain the participant’s consent. Fill out the requested information on the oral consent form. Update this section of the form to include location and have other project personnel assign code numbers later? Give the participant a copy of the GDPR no signature consent document for their records. Conduct the interview (approximately 1 hour in length). See the sociolinguistic interview guide for suggested questions. You may follow the lead of the participant and discuss topics that are of interest to them, but try to include several different topics, and do not focus entirely on the past – ask questions that deal with their current activities and interests. The only obligatory topic is Language (#11), so reserve some time for this at the end of the interview. Complete the demographic questionnaire orally with the participant. Stop recording. Thank the participant for their time and [present them with a thank-you gift (provided by the project leaders) - although we budgeted for this, UGA financial regulations make this very difficult to do.

All researchers on the project will be given access to this folder. When you are working on a particular audio or annotation file, you should download a copy to your local computer to work on, and then upload a new version containing your changes when you are done. See the following section for instructions on naming new versions of existing files. Files containing metadata, logs of work completed, or descriptions of folder contents (readme files) may be edited in OneDrive if you are just adding new information. If your changes involve any deletions or other substantive revisions of existing information, please upload a new version. NEVER DELETE OR OVERWRITE EXISTING FILES IN ONEDRIVE. 2.1 File types and file names used in this project Standard file types used in this project are: Extension Data type .eaf ELAN files .json JSON, for export of ELAN data and conversion to Corpus Workbench (CWB) file format .TextGrid Praat TextGrid .txt readme files .wav audio files .xslx Excel files containing metadata, logs, etc. Audio files and the corresponding annotation files (.TextGrid or .eaf) should be named as follows. Each interview will be identified by a language code (representing the primary variety spoken by the participant) and a sequential three-digit interview number. Since each interview (approximately 1 hour in length) needs to be divided into approximately 10-minute segments, a two-digit segment number is included at the end of the name. language code and interview number - year - month - day when interview was recorded - location _ segment number For example: ckm001-2022-01-16-Trviž_01.wav would be the audio file for the first Čakavian interview, recorded in Trviž on January 16, 2022, segment 1 The corresponding ELAN file containing the transcription and other annotations would have the same name, with the appropriate extension indicating the file type: ckm001-2022-01-16-Trviž_01.eaf The language codes are: Language code Čakavian ckm Fiuman fiu Istriot ist Istro-Romanian ruo Istro-Venetian ivn The language codes follow ISO 639-3 conventions, but there are no established codes for Fiuman or Istro-Venetian. (Venetian has the code vec, but as of now, we are designating Fiuman and Istro-Venetian separately.) Whenever you make a new version of a file, please add your initials and the date to the end of the file name (before the extension) before uploading it to the shared folder. For example, if Keith Langston made changes on September 26, 2022 to the ELAN file listed above, he would upload a new version titled: ckm001-2022-01-16-Trviž_01-kl-2022-09-26.eaf 2.2 Backing up data All data stored in the cloud will be backed up weekly by UGA research assistants.

Place the boundaries between the end of the participant’s answer and the next question from the interviewer, if possible; otherwise place the boundary within a longer pause by the speaker. Label each section with a consecutive number (1, 2, 3, etc.) label the last interval (containing demographic info) as “demographic questionnaire” use Praat script to extract the audio as separate files Edit the names of the .wav and .TextGrid files: the first and last segments should have _consent and _demographic-questionnaire appended, and the remaining files should be numbered consecutively as _01, _02, etc. Make sure that the numbering is correct; you can use the numbers contained in the TextGrid annotations to check your work. 3.2 Speech to text If this is helpful: use BedWord https://mamarcus64.github.io/BedWord/#/ for an automated transcription using standard Croatian / Italian / Romanian orthography. 3.3 Speaker diarization BedWord will output Praat textgrid, but will not separate the different speakers. Add a tier for the second speaker and label tiers appropriately. Divide automatic transcription between tiers and make any adjustments to boundaries as needed (Don’t know whether it will be possible for UGA RAs to do this – transcribers may have to do this themselves, if we end up using the automatic transcription.) Audio file and TextGrid sent to transcriber, who will adjust / add utterance boundaries as needed. 3.4 Forced alignment After transcription is complete, use WebMAUS for forced alignment: resample audio to 16000 Hz in Praat, save as separate file use Python script textgrid_to_par.py to create .par file from TextGrid (convert orthography to SAMPA) [Note: works best to make a new copy of TextGrid file, delete occurrences of @ indicating hesitation, and delete overlapping speech – keep the speech from whichever speaker sounds louder. The script currently has a glitch that doesn’t replace orthographic đ – need to use find and replace to change đ to dZ’] Helpful hint for Mac users: use a dedicated folder to process TextGrid files (e.g. on Desktop), open terminal window at folder, then will just need to enter file name, not full path (use shortened file names for modified files used for processing here) process using WebMAUS General, language independent model [best to use Google Chrome browser] https://clarin.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/BASWebServices/interface/WebMAUSGeneral choose Language: language indep.

Instructions for using Praat for transcription are included in Section 4.1, while the conventions for transcription are described in the following sections. Include other options and instructions for transcribers who are unable to use Praat??, or for when speech to text is not accurate enough to be helpful. Note that if we use a standard Italian or Romanian model for speech to text, the orthography may not match our transcription conventions, which are TBD 4.1 Using Praat to transcribe audio (Transcribers will be trained in Praat prior to beginning their work; these instructions are just a reminder.) Open the .wav and corresponding .TextGrid file in Praat. Start Praat by double-clicking on the Praat icon, use the menu items Open &gt; Read from file, then select the files. Click on the first file in the Praat Objects window and shift click on the second file to select them both. Click the View &amp; Edit button on the right side of the Objects window. Use the in and out buttons on the bottom of the Editor window to zoom in or out as needed. Click in an interval to select it (the active interval will be highlighted in yellow). Use the Tab key to start and stop playback of the audio. You can reselect the interval to move the cursor back to the beginning, or click anywhere in the spectrogram or waveform to place the cursor at the desired position. Adjust the utterance boundaries as needed. Click on a boundary and drag to reposition it. To add a new boundary, click in the spectrogram or waveform to place the cursor, then click in the circle at the top of the tier where you want to place the boundary. To delete a boundary, select the boundary you want to remove and press Alt + Delete (Windows) or Option + Delete (Mac). Type the transcription in the active interval or in the text editor box at the top of the window. Save your work regularly! Praat does not automatically save anything, so be sure to save your TextGrid file (Save &gt; Save as text file) every few minutes. You do NOT need to re-save the audio file, because you will not be making any changes to it. Suggested workflow: It is generally easier to transcribe audio in successive phases: Do a rough transcription that captures all the important words, assigning the transcription to the correct speaker (i.e., making sure that the transcription is in the appropriate tier). Listen to the audio again and add fillers, hesitations, repetitions, self-corrections, and non-linguistic events. Review the transcription for accuracy and make corrections as needed. 4.2 General principles for transcription We use a simple system for transcribing speech. Since the audio is available alongside the transcription, it is not necessary to indicate certain finer details that are marked in some systems of transcription (e.g., measuring pauses or indicating emphasis or intonation patterns). The system described here is similar to the HIAT conventions (https://www.exmaralda.org/pdf/HIAT_EN.pdf) and to conventions often used in conversation analysis. It generally follows standard orthographic principles and uses fewer special symbols than CHAT, GAT2 or the Jeffersonian system of transcription, in order to make the transcription more easily readable. The transcription of individual varieties is described in more detail in the following sections. Rules for transcription Use standard orthography (if there is a standard system), including capitalization. Spell out numbers, dates, and other words that are typically abbreviated in writing. Use conventional spellings for interjections. Common interjections are listed in the sections for the different languages below. Use single parentheses for uncertain words or phrases in the transcription: (word) If a word or phrase is completely unintelligible, write the letter x in single parentheses (x). However, this should be used only as a last resort. Whenever possible, make your best guess as to what was said and enclose it in parentheses, as noted above. Leaving unintelligible words or phrases as (x) may cause problems in the automatic alignment of the transcription with the audio. Use standard punctuation to terminate complete utterances: assertions . questions ? exclamations ! Self interruptions or hesitations followed by retracing, repair, or reformulation are indicated by a single hyphen, followed by a blank space: - . For example: i- i- i- vajk su gledali za nikako poć napret ‘and- and- and- they always looked to get ahead somehow’. If the word is incomplete, transcribe as much as you hear; e.g., Is- Istra A short pause within an utterance is indicated by a period within single parentheses: (.) An audible breath within an utterance is indicated by ((breath)). If there is a breath during a pause between utterances, no notation is needed. Other non-linguistic events are described in double parentheses; e.g. ((coughs)), ((laughs)), etc. These can be labeled in English, Croatian, or Italian. Example: @ Trviž je- @ Trviš kako Trviš je @- je @ (.) mićo mesto, nekih @ ((coughs)) (dvestotinjak) judi ima, ali @ s- župa Trviš ima- je veća.  ‘Uh Trviž is- uh Trviž itself is uh- is uh a little place, it has some (two hundred) people, but uh s- Trviž Parish has- is bigger.’ 4.3 Čakavian and Štokavian varieties Use characters from the standard Croatian alphabet. Čakavian [tj] and Štokavian [tɕ] are both written with the character ć. Diphthongs are written as a sequence of two vowels; e.g., ie, uo. These are standard practices in Croatian dialectology, and they make the transcription accessible for Croatian speakers. Some Čakavian varieties may require additional characters, which are indicated in parentheses. a b c č ć d đ dž e f g h i j k l lj m n nj o p r s š t u v z ž (å = [ɒ], ẹ = close [e] vs. e = open [ɛ], ọ = close [o] vs. o = open [ɔ], ü = [y], ö, ə, ɣ, x) In dialects that have consistent word-final devoicing, this should be indicated in the transcription. [?? not sure if this is a good idea; voicing may vary within the same variety or speaker, depending on the context] Common fillers indicating hesitation: @ = [ə] (like English “uh”; no conventional spelling exists in Croatian), hm Common interjections indicating speaker attitudes/feelings: uh, oh, eh, ih, ah, joj, ijuju, oho, ej, haj, hoj, uf, pi, fuj, juhuhu, kuku, ao, ua 4.4 Istro-Romanian use Zvjezdana’s system 4.5 Istriot no standard way of writing this; speakers of different varieties may write things differently, so we need to come up with our own conventions 4.6 Istro-Venetian and Fiuman This orthographic transcription system was developed and agreed upon during the Endangered Languages in Contact (ELIC) workshop at the University of Rijeka and University in Pula in June 2023 by a working group consisting of Zvjezdana Vrzić, Ivana Lalli-Paćelat, Sarah Zancovich, Milena Korenika, and Dario Ban. It is an attempt to transcribe the audio recordings orthographically (i.e. not by using the International Phonetic Alphabet) as consistently as possible, while taking into account existing written usage in Istro-Venetian/Fiuman. Since a standard orthography does not exist for Istro-Venetian/Fiuman, the written form of the variety varies from author to author and resource to resource. This is not an attempt to propose a standard way of writing this variety. General conventions (in addition to those given at the beginning of Section 4.2): Use standard Italian orthography unless special orthographic transcription conventions are necessary for Istro-Venetian/Fiuman (see below). Use standard Italian orthography when, according to your judgment, it is clear that the speaker is saying a word or a phrase in standard Italian, e.g. st. It. scuola, not Istro-Ven./Fium. scola. Use standard Croatian orthography when, according to your judgment, it is clear that the speaker is saying a word or a phrase in (standard) Croatian, e.g. mi son zadužena per le torte The following table lists graphemes or digraphs (i.e., letters or combinations of letters) specific to Istro-Venetian/Fiuman.

[šč]/[šć](IPA [ʃtʃ]/[ɕtɕ]) mas’cio, s’ciopar It. maschio, scoppiare Other orthographic conventions As a general rule, do not use geminated (double) consonants (except as indicated in the table above). For example, you should normally write tuto (not tutto).However, per the directions above, you should mark a geminated consonant if the pronunciation immediately strikes you as containing one, suggesting the use of standard Italian pronunciation (e.g., if the speaker clearly pronounces [tutto], you may write tutto). You do not need to specifically listen for the distinction between single and geminated consonants, which is often very subtle. When in doubt, use a single consonant. Mark accents when the position of the stress diverges from the usual stress pattern (as is also done in standard Italian).in truncated past participles; e.g., go publicà, vegnù, gavèin specific lexical items; e.g., ventitré, università, città, cussì, però, perché, più, ciò, là, lì, né, sé, sì, tè Use an apostrophe, following the standard Italian usage, to mark the cases of elisione; e.g., l’ (for la) Do not use an apostrophe, following the standard Italian usage, to mark the cases of troncamento; e.g., dess (for adesso), do (for dove). Exceptionally, use an apostrophe when troncamento happens at the beginning of the word and in certain exceptional cases, such as t’sa (for ti sa).Examples:’na volta (for una volta)’vanti (for avanti)’demo, ’ndemo (for andemo)’sta (for questa) Transcribe the definite article and complex prepositions (prepositions with articles) as shown in the following table.

Annotation instructions for the individual languages are given in the following sections. Sample ELAN grid with tiers for speaker and interviewer 5.1 Using ELAN to annotate audio (add basic instructions; annotators will be trained to use ELAN) 5.2 Lemmatization A lemma is the “basic” form of the word, normally the citation form that is used as the head word in dictionary entries. Lemmas should be entered in the Lemma tier for each corresponding form on the Words tier. You do not need to enter lemmas for fillers like “uh”, “um” (whatever their form in the individual languages) that simply indicate hesitation and have no real meaning. Lemmas are written using the transcription conventions for the individual variety. Proper nouns are capitalized, but other forms are in lower case. (Examples below are in italics, to set them off from the rest of the text, but in ELAN everything will be in plain text, without this formatting.) 5.2.1 Čakavian The citation forms used as lemmas are as follows: for nouns: nominative singular. For example, the lemma for the word-form vuci ‘wolves’ is vuk) for pronouns: nominative singular (masculine, if the form is a pronominal modifier). For example, the lemma for ga ‘him’ (3Sing.Masc.Gen-Acc) is on ‘he’; the lemma for tu ‘that’ (Fem.Acc.Sing) is taj. for adjectives: nominative singular masculine indefinite (or definite, if a distinct indefinite form is not used/does not exist). For example, the lemma for dobre ‘good’ (Fem.Gen.Sing) is dobar. For comparative and superlative forms, use the positive degree as the lemma, unless the comparative form is suppletive. For example, the lemma for topliji ‘warmer’ is topao, but the lemma for najbolji ‘best’ is bolji, and not dobar. for adverbs: even though most adverbs are formed regularly from adjectives, they should be lemmatized as adverbs (e.g., dobro ‘good’, and not dobar) for verbs: infinitive. If the variety being transcribed normally has infinitives in -t or -ć (without the final -i; e.g., kantat ‘to sing’), then this is the form that you should use for the lemma. If it is not clear whether the form represents a code-switch to standard Croatian/štokavian, you may put the final -i in parentheses; e.g., pjevat(i). 5.2.2 Istro-Romanian 5.2.3 Istriot 5.2.4 Istro-Venetian 5.3 Part of speech tags The part of speech for individual words is labeled in the POS tier. This project uses a slightly modified version of the Universal Dependencies tagset, which aims to provide a standard system for all languages and is becoming increasingly widely used in corpora. Some of the main differences are: all types of conjunctions are labeled simply as CONJ in this corpus, while the Universal Dependencies tagset distinguishes between coordinating conjunctions and subordinating conjunctions personal names are distinguished from other types of proper nouns (so that they can be masked in the audio) the copula is not distinguished from ‘to be’ as an auxiliary verb (both are labeled as AUX) We also do not label punctuation or symbols, since this is a spoken corpus. The labels for part of speech (POS) tags are shown in the table below. POS tags should be written in all caps, as shown here. Part of speech Tag noun NOUN personal name NAME other proper noun PROPN pronoun PRON adjective ADJ adverb ADV verb VERB auxiliary verb, including copula AUX preposition or postposition ADP conjunction CONJ numeral NUM determiner DET interjection INTJ particle PART Following UD, we use the DET part of speech for Slavic varieties included in this corpus, despite the fact that they lack definite or indefinite articles and that traditional grammatical descriptions do not refer to determiners; see https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/DET.html . Although there is disagreement about whether languages without articles require us to posit a DP in the syntactic structure, the category of DET is used here in order to promote consistency in the tagging of the different varieties included in the corpus. Examples from the individual languages are given in the following sections. 5.3.1 Čakavian Note: Čakavian examples are cited as generic ekavian forms. Individual dialects may have other phonological differences. There are two auxiliary verbs, bit(i) ‘be’ and htet(i). The verb bit(i) is also tagged as AUX when it is used as a copula. The common expression po domaći / po domaće / po domaću should be written as two separate words, but treated as a single unit (ADV) in the forced alignment and ELAN annotations. According to UD, “Determiners are words that modify nouns or noun phrases and express the reference of the noun phrase in context.” The DET tag includes the following groups of forms: Pronominal modifiers: possessive pronouns (moj ‘my’, naš ‘our’, etc.), demonstratives (taj ‘that’, takov ‘that kind of’, etc.), interrogative, indefinite, and relative pronominal modifiers (ki ‘which’, neki ‘some’, kakov ‘what kind of’, čigov ‘whose’, etc.) Quantifiers: (sa(v) ‘all, the whole’, s(v)aki ‘each, every’, malo ‘little’, etc.), excluding numerals, which have their own separate tag (NUM) Notice that the same form may be tagged differently depending on its function: e.g., in kade so prodavali svega ‘where they were selling everything [all sorts of things]’, svega should be tagged as PRON and not DET; in the phrase malo boje ‘a little better’, malo should be tagged as ADV and not DET. Other common forms with multiple uses/functions: ADD i “AND” and other examples as needed Form POS and examples ča PRON interrogative ‘what?’: Ča si prnesal? ‘What did you bring?’PRON relative ‘that’: moja sestra, ona ča je va Ljubljane ‘my sister, the one who lives in Ljubljana’PRON indefinite ‘something’: Daj mi ča za pojist! ‘Give me something to eat!’ADV interrogative ‘why’: Ma ča zustajo odzat? ‘Why are they lagging behind?’ADV ‘as much as’: ča prvo ‘as soon as possible’CONJ ‘that, because, since’: i bil je kuntenat ča je prišal ‘and he was happy that he came’PART interrogative: ča ne? ‘isn’t it so?’ Particles include forms such as baš, evo, god, li, ono, etc. Forms like znači ‘so, thus, therefore’ (i.e., used as a discourse marker rather than a verb) should also be tagged as PART. 5.3.2 Istro-Romanian 5.3.3 Istriot 5.3.4 Istro-Venetian 5.4 Morphosyntactic features Morphosyntactic features (e.g., number, gender, case, tense) are given in the Feats tier for each individual word (where relevant). As with the POS tags, this corpus uses a slightly modified version of the Universal Dependencies feature inventory. In particular, some tags have been changed to make all POS and morphosyntactic feature tags distinct (e.g., UD uses PART for “particle” and Part for “participle”). Labels that are different from those in the UD inventory are shown in green. The first letter of the labels for morphosyntactic features is capitalized, and different features are separated by a period. Features should be listed in the order shown in the tables below. The abbreviations are mainly self-explanatory, but an alphabetic list of abbreviations is given at the end. Since the different languages have different grammatical systems, separate tables are given by language. 5.4.1 Čakavian Note that we do not code definiteness or indefiniteness for adjectives, since this is not readily apparent in many instances. We also do not code for animacy, because this should be clear from the meaning and form of the noun (and any associated modifiers). Unlike the UD practices for some Slavic treebanks, we do code aspect, but these labels are presumptive, based on the context and on morphological features of the verbs in question; without a detailed study of the aspectual usage in individual varieties, we cannot be certain in all instances that these are correct. Only perfective (Pfv) aspect is marked overtly (see below). Other differences from UD (indicated in green): For some parts of speech, certain feature values are considered the default value and are unmarked (e.g., positive degree for adjectives, imperfective aspect for verbs) In some instances, abbreviations have been changed to make them unique (e.g., UD specifies Imp as the abbreviation for both imperative mood and imperfective aspect) or to conform to widely used standard terminology (e.g., Coll “collective” for collective numerals, rather than “Sets” in UD) Abbreviations have been added for categories not included in UD POS Features ADJ Degree: (positive is unmarked), Cmp, SupGender: Masc, Fem, NeutCase: Nom, Gen, Dat, Acc, Ins, Loc, VocNumber: Sing, Plur, Pauc(Definiteness: not marked) ADP — ADV Degree: (positive is unmarked), Cmp, Sup AUX Type: Cl (non-clitic forms are unmarked)Tense/Mood: Pres, Pfv.Pres, Aor, Impf, CndPerson/Number: 1Sing, 2Sing, 3Sing, 1Plur, 2Plur, 3Plur CONJ — DET pronominal modifiers have the same features as adjectives (except for degree) quantifiers that do not agree (e.g., koliko, malo, etc.) do not require feature specifications INTJ — NOUN (NAME, PROPN) Type: CollGender: Masc, Fem, NeutCase: Nom, Gen, Dat, Acc, Ins, Loc, VocNumber: Sing, Plur, Pauc NUM Type: Card, Ord, Coll(Plus gender, case, number features where relevant) PRON Type: Cl.Prs (clitic forms), Prs (full/stressed forms), Ind, Int, Neg, Refl, Rel(Plus gender, case, number features as relevant) VERB Aspect: (imperfective or bi-aspectual verbs are unmarked), PfvMood: (indicative is unmarked), ImpTense: Pres, Past, Aor, ImpfPerson/Number: 1Sing, 2Sing, 3Sing, 1Plur, 2Plur, 3PlurVoice: (active is unmarked), PassType: (finite is unmarked), Inf, Ptcp, Conv(For participles: also gender, case, number features as relevant) add examples 5.4.2 Istro-Romanian 5.4.3 Istriot and Istro-Venetian 5.5 Language contact phenomena In order to identify possible language contact phenomena of interest for future research (nonce borrowings, code-switches or language mixing), we include a special tier for each speaker in the ELAN files, labeled LC. Simply enter the letter y (for “yes”) if you think the word in question reflects some type of language contact. Established borrowings that are used by most/all speakers and that are considered part of the dialect do not need to be indicated; e.g., the use of Venetian borrowings such as anke, forši, etc. in čakavian dialects. 5.6 Translation The corpus will include a free translation of the individual utterances. Slavic varieties will be translated into English, and Romance varieties into English and Croatian.
